*Instructions for users with Stylish:*
 - Create a new User Style called `uBlock Deluxe Chrome`.
 - Point to `userChrome.css` in this repo (`https://github.com/Gitoffthelawn/uBlock-Deluxe/blob/master/userChrome.css`), or simply cut and paste the code.
 - Create a new User Style called `uBlock Deluxe Content`.
 - Point to `userContent.css` in this repo (`https://github.com/Gitoffthelawn/uBlock-Deluxe/blob/master/userContent.css`), or simply cut and paste the code.
 
*Instructions for users without Stylish:*
 - Copy userChrome.css and userContent.css into the `chrome` folder in your Firefox *profile* folder.
 - If the `chrome` folder does not exist, simply create one first.
 - Note that the *profile* folder is not the same as the *application* folder.
 - To find your *profile* folder, enter `about:support` into the Firefox location bar, and then click on the `Show Folder` button in the `Profile Folder` line.
