I simply would like to know if anyone is using it and if anyone appreciates it.

Instructions:
 - Copy userChrome.css and userContent.css into the `chrome` folder in your Firefox profile folder.
 - If the `chrome` folder does not exist, simply create one first.
 - Note that the profile folder is not the same as the application folder.
 - To find your profile folder, enter `about:support` into the Firefox location bar, and then click on the `Show Folder` button in the `Profile Folder` line.
